## Updated Summary:
On a cold April day in London, where clocks strike thirteen, Winston Smith hurries into Victory Mansions, a building smelling of boiled cabbage and old mats. A large poster dominates the entrance, featuring the face of a man with a black mustache and the caption "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU." The elevator is out of service, forcing Winston, a 39-year-old man with a varicose ulcer, to climb seven flights of stairs, each landing displaying the same poster.

Inside his apartment, a telescreen broadcasts information about iron production, its volume adjustable but impossible to turn off completely. Winston, wearing the blue uniform of the Party, looks out the window at a bleak cityscape. Wind and dust swirl through the streets, and posters of the mustached man are ubiquitous. A torn poster reveals the word "INGSOC," and a police patrol gyro copter flies overhead. The telescreen both transmits and receives, monitoring sounds and visuals, making privacy nonexistent.

Winston reflects on London's dilapidated state, filled with decaying buildings and bomb sites, and his inability to recall a different past. He considers the Ministry of Truth, a massive white pyramidal structure that towers over the city, displaying the Party's slogans: "WAR IS PEACE," "FREEDOM IS SLAVERY," "IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH." The Ministry is one of four, the others being the Ministry of Peace (war), the Ministry of Love (law and order), and the Ministry of Plenty (economics). The Ministry of Love is particularly fearsome, windowless and heavily guarded.

Winston drinks a shot of Victory Gin to brace himself, then retrieves a pen, ink, and a blank diary from a drawer. The telescreen's unusual placement allows him to sit in an alcove, partially hidden from its view. He acquired the diary from a junk shop, drawn to its quality paper, a forbidden act for Party members. He writes the date, "April 4th, 1984," unsure if the year is accurate. He wonders who he is writing for, questioning the possibility of communicating with the future.

Winston struggles to write, his mind blank. The telescreen blares military music. He begins to write rapidly, almost in a panic, about a film he saw the night before, a war movie featuring a refugee ship being bombed, with graphic scenes of a man trying to escape a helicopter attack. The film depicted a fat man trying to swim away from the bombing, getting shot and sinking into the water. A lifeboat full of children was also bombed. One scene showed a close-up of a child's arm flying through the air after the explosion. While many applauded, a prole woman protested, but the police dragged her away.

Winston stops writing because he gets cramps and because he finds his writing to be nonsensical. However, writing about the film helps him remember something else that prompted him to start the diary: an incident that morning at the Ministry of Truth.

At 11:05 AM in the Records Department, Winston and his colleagues prepared for the Two Minutes Hate in front of the telescreen. Winston was sitting down when a dark-haired woman from the Fiction Department and O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party, entered the room. Winston found the woman intimidating; he disliked her athleticism, her allegiance to the Anti-Sex League, and her apparent devotion to the Party. He even briefly suspected her of being a Thought Police agent. O'Brien's presence caused a stir. He was a large man with a coarse face but pleasant manners. Winston felt drawn to O'Brien, suspecting that his political orthodoxy might not be perfect. He thought O'Brien looked intelligent and like someone he could talk to. O'Brien sat two seats away from Winston, with a sandy-haired woman between them. The dark-haired woman sat behind Winston.

A screeching noise signaled the start of the Two Minutes Hate. Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, appeared on the screen. Goldstein, a former Party leader turned traitor, was portrayed as the source of all crimes against the Party. He has a thin, Jewish face with white hair and a goatee, and his voice was sheep-like. Goldstein delivered his usual speech, attacking the Party's doctrines, denouncing Big Brother, and advocating for freedom. Images of Eurasian soldiers marched behind him. Within thirty seconds, the audience was consumed by rage. Fear and anger arose automatically at the sight of Goldstein.

By the second minute, the Hate reached a frenzy. People screamed and jumped, trying to drown out Goldstein's voice. The sandy-haired woman turned red, and O'Brien sat rigidly, breathing heavily. The dark-haired woman behind Winston threw a dictionary at the telescreen, hitting Goldstein's nose. Winston found himself screaming and kicking his chair. The Two Minutes Hate was impossible to avoid; one was swept up in an ecstasy of fear, revenge, and a desire to kill. The rage was abstract and could be directed at different targets. At times, Winston hated Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police, siding with Goldstein. At other times, he hated Goldstein and adored Big Brother. Winston briefly managed to redirect his hate toward the dark-haired woman behind him, fantasizing about violent acts he would commit against her. He realized he hated her because she was young, beautiful, and seemingly asexual, and because he desired her but knew he could never have her.

Later, Winston visits the Parsons' apartment. Mrs. Parsons is frazzled by her unruly children, who are upset that they might miss the public hanging of Eurasian prisoners convicted of war crimes. As Winston leaves, the boy shoots him in the neck with a slingshot, yelling "Goldstein!" Mrs. Parsons looks terrified and helpless. Back in his apartment, Winston reflects on how children are systematically turned into savage, ungovernable spies by organizations like the Spies, which encourages them to denounce their parents for heresy.

Winston remembers a dream he had years ago, where someone in a dark room told him, "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness." He now believes that the voice belonged to O'Brien. He feels a strong connection to O'Brien, regardless of whether he is a friend or an enemy. He is interrupted by a telescreen announcement of a victory in South India, which Winston suspects will be followed by a reduction in the chocolate ration. He feels despondent.

Looking out the window, Winston sees the word "INGSOC" on a poster and considers the Party's principles: Newspeak, doublethink, and the mutability of the past. He feels isolated and wonders if anyone else shares his views. He looks at a coin with the slogans "WAR IS PEACE," "FREEDOM IS SLAVERY," "IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH" and Big Brother's image, realizing the Party is inescapable. He feels anguish at the power of the Ministry of Truth, wondering for whom he is writing his diary. He has a moment of clarity when he realizes that remaining sane is a form of resistance. He writes a message for the future, for a time when people can think freely.

Winston understands that he is already dead, that writing the diary is a thoughtcrime punishable by death. He reflects that the consequences of every act are included in the act itself. He writes that thoughtcrime *is* death. He notices ink stains on his fingers, a detail that could betray him, and carefully washes them off in the bathroom. He hides the diary in a drawer and places a particle of dust on the cover to see if it has been disturbed.

Winston dreams of his mother and sister, whom he vaguely remembers from his childhood. They are in a sinking ship, looking at him from the depths as they drown. He understands that their lives were sacrificed for his survival. He believes that tragedy and deep emotions are no longer possible in the present day. He then dreams of the Golden Country, a landscape of rolling hills and a clear stream. The dark-haired woman from the Fiction Department comes towards him and throws off her clothes.

At work, Winston must rewrite a speech by Big Brother to correct a factual error. Comrade Withers, once mentioned favorably, has fallen out of favor and become an "unperson." Winston decides to invent a new hero, Comrade Ogilvy, a model Party member. He dictates a biography of Ogilvy, emphasizing his dedication to the Party from a young age: rejecting toys for weapons, joining the Spies early, denouncing his uncle, inventing a grenade, and dying heroically in battle. Winston considers giving Ogilvy an award but decides against it to avoid creating conflicts with other records. He notices a colleague, Tillotson, likely doing the same task. Winston is confident his version will be chosen.

In the canteen, Winston is approached by Syme, a philologist specializing in Newspeak. Winston lies about having razor blades, a scarce commodity. Syme discusses the previous day's hanging of prisoners, focusing on the spectacle of their tongues turning blue. They collect their meager rations: stew, bread, cheese, Victory Coffee, and saccharine. Syme explains the purpose of Newspeak: to limit thought by reducing the number of words. He describes the destruction of words, including synonyms and antonyms, and the simplification of language through prefixes like "plus" and "doubleplus." Syme believes Newspeak will eventually make thoughtcrime impossible. Winston senses that Syme is too intelligent and will be vaporized. Syme predicts that by 2050, no one will understand Oldspeak, and all past literature will be destroyed or converted into Newspeak. He states that orthodoxy means unconsciousness. Winston almost mentions the proles as an exception to this, but Syme is interrupted.

The creation of Newspeak prioritizes ease of pronunciation over all other considerations except accuracy of
