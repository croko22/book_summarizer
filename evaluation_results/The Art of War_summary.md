*   Lionel Giles' translation features an introduction and critical annotations for context and interpretation.
*   The book begins with a Project Gutenberg Etext preface, a preface by Lionel Giles, and an introduction, followed by thirteen chapters. These chapters cover strategic planning, warfare conduct, offensive and defensive strategies, tactical deployment, energy management, exploiting weaknesses, maneuvering, adapting tactics, army management during marches, terrain analysis, handling diverse combat situations, fire-based attacks, and strategic use of spies.

**Preface to the Project Gutenberg Etext Summary:**

*   Before Giles's translation, "The Art of War" was relatively unknown in Europe.
*   Joseph Amiot's earlier French translation was considered inaccurate.
*   Capt. E.F. Calthrop's previous English translation was criticized by Giles for inaccuracies and omissions.
*   Giles aimed to create a more scholarly and accurate translation.
*   Subsequent editions often used Giles's work; his 1910 edition was the most comprehensive, containing extensive information.
*   The Giles edition, intended for scholars, includes the Chinese text, English translation, and detailed notes (some with Chinese characters), which complicated the conversion to etext format.
*   The converter paraphrased when necessary, preserving as much original text as possible.

**Lionel Giles's Preface Summary:**

*   He criticizes Capt. E.F. Calthrop's English translation for errors, omissions, and distortions.
*   Giles defends his translation as an improvement.
*   Giles highlights features of his edition, including numbered paragraphs, a concordance of Chinese characters, and notes placed directly after relevant passages.
*   He used the best native commentaries and incorporated Chinese text where applicable.

**Introduction Summary:**

*   The introduction provides background on Sun Tzu's life and the historical context of "The Art of War."
*   It recounts a story from Ssu-ma Ch’ien about Sun Tzu demonstrating his military skills by training the King of Wu's concubines.
*   After this demonstration, Sun Tzu was appointed general and led Wu to military successes.
*   The introduction discusses debates about Sun Tzu's existence and the authenticity of his work.
*   It references historical sources, including the Shih Chi, Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu, Huai-nan Tzŭ, and Han Shu.
*   The introduction explores the potential origins of the "82 p’ien" mentioned in the Han Shu, suggesting they may have included apocryphal writings attributed to Sun Tzu.
*   It presents arguments for and against the traditional dating of Sun Tzu's work, noting its absence in the Tso Chuan.
*   The introduction analyzes internal evidence, such as references to Wu-Yüeh relations and the ancient land-tenure system, to estimate the period of composition.
*   It concludes that Sun Tzu likely lived and wrote towards the end of the "Spring and Autumn" period, potentially serving under Ho Lu of Wu.

**Text of Sun Tzu Summary:**

*   The eBook's text is based on Sun Hsing-yen's edition, considered the closest to Sun Tzu's original writings.
*   Sun Hsing-yen discovered a copy of Chi T’ien-pao’s long-lost work in the Hua-yin temple library.
*   Sun Hsing-yen's edition was based on Chi T’ien-pao’s work, which allowed him to restore doubtful passages by comparing them with older versions.

**The Commentators Summary:**

*   The book includes commentaries from scholars and military figures, including Ts’ao Ts’ao (Wei Wu Ti).
*   Meng Shih is another commentator, though his identity is debated.
*   Li Ch’uan (8th century) wrote about military tactics, and his works remained in use. He used a variant text of Sun Tzu.
*   Tu Yu (died 812) included notes in his work *T’ung Tien*, repeating Ts’ao Kung and Meng Shih.
*   Tu Mu (803-852), a poet, discussed military matters and used historical parallels in his notes.
*   Ch’en Hao, a contemporary of Tu Mu, wrote a new commentary because he found Ts’ao Kung's too obscure and Tu Mu's too verbose.
*   Chia Lin lived under the T’ang dynasty. His commentary is concise and considered the least valuable.
*   Mei Yao-ch’en (1002-1060), a poet, wrote a commentary focused on brevity and logical sequence.
*   Wang Hsi of the Sung dynasty offered original interpretations and revised the ancient text of Sun Tzu.
*   Ho Yen-Hsi of the Sung dynasty provided "helpful additions" to the text.
*   Chang Yu, the last commentator listed, expanded on Ts’ao Kung's terse sentences.

**Appreciations of Sun Tzŭ:**

*   Sun Tzŭ has fascinated many of China’s greatest men, including generals Han Hsin, Feng I, Lu Meng, and Yo Fei.
*   Ts’ao Kung and Su Hsun admired Sun Tzu’s work.
*   Cheng Hou stated that Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters are essential for military training.
*   Chu Hsi acknowledged the importance of Sun Tzŭ’s work but disliked the comparison with classical works.

**Apologies for War:**

*   China's history includes both peace-loving sentiments and extensive experience with warfare.
*   Some literati defended warfare on principle.
*   Ssu-ma Ch’ien argued that military weapons are used by sages to punish violence and give peace.
*   Tu Mu defined war as a function of government, like punishment, for eliminating wickedness.
*   Chu Hsi and Sun Hsing-yen cited the Classics and Confucius to justify military action in certain circumstances.

**Bibliography:**

*   The oldest Chinese treatises on war after Sun Tzŭ include works by Wu Ch’i, Ssu-ma Jang-chu, Lu Wang, Wei Liao, Huang-shih Kung, Li Ching, and Feng Hou.
*   Chinese encyclopedias contain sections devoted to the literature of war.

**Chapter I. LAYING PLANS:**

*   Sun Tzŭ asserts that the art of war is vital to the State, influencing survival, security, and national ruin.
*   The art of war is governed by five constant factors: the Moral Law (harmony between the people and their ruler), Heaven (environmental conditions), Earth (terrain), the Commander, and Method and discipline.
*   Earth comprises distances, danger, security, open ground, narrow passes, and the chances of life and death.

**Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG:**

*   Water, fire, wood, metal, and earth, the five elements, are not always equally predominant.
*   The four seasons alternate.
*   Days have varying lengths, and the moon has cycles of waxing and waning.
*   The text uses natural changes to illustrate the lack of fixity in war.

**Chapter VII. MANEUVERING:**

*   The general receives commands from the sovereign.
*   The general must harmonize the army before encamping.
*   Tactical maneuvering is difficult.
*   The difficulty involves turning the devious into the direct and misfortune into gain. This involves misleading the enemy to arrive first.
*   Taking a long, circuitous route to reach the goal before the enemy demonstrates knowledge of deviation.
*   Maneuvering with a disciplined army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, it's dangerous.
*   Setting a fully equipped army in motion to snatch an advantage may result in being too late, while detaching a flying column sacrifices baggage and stores.
*   Forced marches covering double the usual distance can lead to the capture of division leaders.
*   Marching fifty li to outmaneuver the enemy results in losing the first division leader, and only half the force reaching the goal.
*   Marching thirty li results in two-thirds of the army arriving.
*   An army without its baggage-train, provisions, or bases of supply is lost.
*   Alliances should not be entered into without knowing the designs of neighbors.
*   An army leader must be familiar with the terrain, including mountains, forests, pitfalls, precipices, marshes, and swamps.
*   Natural advantages can only be utilized with local guides.
*   Dissimulation is key to success in war

**Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES:**
