## Updated Summary:
The Project Gutenberg eBook "Notes from the Underground" by Fyodor Dostoevsky is freely available under the Project Gutenberg License, with few restrictions in the United States and most other countries. The ebook, released on July 1, 1996, and last updated December 26, 2021, features an English version by Judith Boss and an HTML version by Al Haines.

The novel consists of two parts, "Underground" and "À Propos of the Wet Snow." An "Author's Note" presents the diary and its author as fictional, yet representative of individuals shaped by societal conditions. Part I introduces the underground man and his worldview, explaining his origins. Part II comprises the protagonist's notes about his life experiences.

In Part I, the 40-year-old unnamed narrator, a former government official, describes himself as a sick, spiteful, and unattractive man, possibly with a diseased liver. He refuses medical care out of spite, aware of his self-destructive tendencies. He admits to rudeness towards petitioners and holds a grudge against an officer over a trivial matter. He recognizes his spite as superficial and feels ashamed. He believes himself incapable of genuine spite or kindness, finding comfort in the idea that intelligent men are inherently ineffectual. He lives impoverished in Petersburg with a disagreeable servant.

The narrator questions his self-worth, even contemplating becoming an insect. He claims excessive consciousness is a disease, especially in Petersburg. He observes his tendency to commit offensive acts when most aware of goodness, and to indulge in degradation. He conceals this from others, yet derives a perverse pleasure from his debasement, fueled by his acute awareness of his own degradation and feeling of entrapment.

The narrator acknowledges his strong ego and sensitivity to insults. He claims he would welcome a slap to experience the enjoyment of despair. He blames himself for everything due to his intelligence and the laws of nature, arguing that even magnanimity would only increase his suffering.

He contrasts himself with decisive, "direct" persons, envying them despite seeing them as stupid. The acutely conscious man views himself as a spiteful mouse, unable to believe in the justice of revenge, and creating a "stinking mess" of doubts and emotions. The mouse retreats into its hole, consumed by decades of spite, finding enjoyment in despair and inward-turned desires. He argues that people with strong nerves cannot understand this refinement of enjoyment and are immediately defeated by impossibilities, such as the laws of nature or mathematics.

The narrator rejects the laws of nature and arithmetic, arguing that understanding impossibilities is preferable to accepting them if they are repugnant.

He argues that there is enjoyment even in toothache, especially for an educated 19th-century man who moans not merely from pain, but as a man influenced by progress and civilization, divorced from the soil.

He questions whether a man who enjoys his degradation can respect himself. He describes instances of feigning penitence, only to later realize it was a lie. He invented adventures and deliberately took offense. He twice tried to be in love, but lacked faith in his own suffering. Consciousness leads to inertia, while "direct" persons act because of their stupidity and limited perspective, finding simple justifications for their actions. He cannot find justice or virtue, so he acts out of spite, but even spite disintegrates. He gives up because he cannot find a fundamental cause.

He regrets his inability to even be lazy, which would be a positive trait. He imagines himself as a sluggard with sympathies for the sublime and beautiful, drinking to their health.

He critiques the idea that people only do nasty things because they are ignorant of their own interests. He insists people often act against their interests out of obstinacy. He questions whether human advantages have been fully accounted for, pointing out that statisticians omit the desire to act against one's own interests. He claims that something dearer than self-interest must exist for almost everyone, and that systems designed to regenerate mankind through self-interest are merely logical exercises. Civilization does not necessarily reduce bloodthirstiness but provides more sophisticated means of enjoying bloodshed. He anticipates science explaining all human actions through natural laws, resulting in a world of calculation and tabulation.

The narrator imagines a gentleman disrupting this rational utopia by advocating for chaos and irrationality. He claims people prefer to act as they choose, not as reason dictates, and that free choice, caprice, and fancy are the most advantageous advantages, which are continually being shattered to atoms.

The narrator anticipates the argument that choice is an illusion, as science will eventually explain all desires. He agrees that discovering a formula for all desires will turn people into emotionless automatons. He then asks the reader to assess the likelihood of this happening.

The narrator asserts that nature operates independently of human consent, and aspiring to formulas and rules necessitates accepting the consequences. He acknowledges his over-philosophical nature, attributing it to his forty years underground. He argues that reason is limited and only satisfies the rational side of human nature, while will encompasses the entirety of human life, including impulses. He wants to live fully, not just exercise his capacity for reasoning. Reason only knows what it has learned, while human nature acts as a whole, consciously or unconsciously. He argues that humans may intentionally desire what is harmful or stupid simply to have the right to desire it, even if irrational. This caprice may be more advantageous than anything else, preserving personality and individuality. Choice can align with reason, but is often stubbornly opposed to it, which can also be profitable. He argues that if humans are not stupid, then they are monstrously ungrateful and morally oblique.

He challenges the notion that history is rational, pointing to its chaotic and often absurd nature. Moral and rational individuals often betray their own principles. He suggests that even when showered with earthly blessings, humans will act out of spite and introduce a fatal fantastic element into their lives. People will cling to their fantastic dreams and vulgar follies to prove that they are not piano keys controlled by the laws of nature. Even if proven to be mere piano keys, people would act perversely out of ingratitude. If they cannot find the means, they will contrive destruction and suffering to assert their humanity, even through a curse. If even curses can be calculated, humans would purposely go mad to escape reason and prove their humanity. He suggests that all of human work is proving they are human and not piano-keys, even at the cost of their skin or cannibalism.

He asks if it is not tempting to rejoice that desire still depends on something unknown. He anticipates the argument that free will is not being touched, only that it should coincide with normal interests and the laws of nature and arithmetic. He mocks the idea of free will when it comes to tabulation and arithmetic, where everything is a matter of "twice two make four" without his will.

The narrator admits he is joking and that his jokes are not brilliant. He is tormented by questions. He asks why reform man's will according to science and good sense, and how do you know it is desirable or beneficial to man. He questions the assumption that not acting against one's real normal interests is always advantageous and a law for mankind. He argues that this is only a supposition and may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity.

He agrees that man is a creative animal, destined to strive consciously for an object. He suggests that the reason man sometimes deviates from the path may be that he is predestined to make the road, and that the destination is less important than the process of making it. He asks why man has such a passionate love for destruction and chaos. He suggests that man loves chaos because he is afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is constructing. He only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will leave it for the use of domesticated animals. He argues that man is a frivolous and incongruous creature, who loves the process of the game, not the end of it. He suggests that the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula. Man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty.

He argues that mathematical certainty is insufferable. "Twice two makes four" is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. He admits that "twice two makes four" is an excellent thing, but "twice two makes five" is sometimes a very charming thing too.

He questions why only the normal and positive is for the advantage of man. He asks if reason is not in error as regards advantage, and if man does not love suffering as much as well-being. Man is sometimes passionately in love with suffering, and that is a fact. He argues that to care only for well-being seems positively ill-bred. It is sometimes very pleasant to smash things. He stands for his caprice, and for its being guaranteed to him when necessary. Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness, which is infinitely superior to "twice two makes four". Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand. While if you stick to consciousness, you can at least flog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up.

He argues that he is afraid of the "palace of crystal" because it can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one's tongue out at it even on the sly. He would rather live in a mansion than a hen-house. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream.
